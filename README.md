# Evolving Tinder
This repository contains the code and report for the project "Evolving Tinder," which was developed as part of an elective course at my University. The project aims to address the limitations of the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) by employing an evolutionary approach to achieve a more balanced and stable matching between two sets of individuals with subjective preferences.

## Abstract
The Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) is an iterative method to find a stable matching between two sets of individuals with subjective preferences, referred to as a 1-to-1 matching scenario. However, the DAA matching turns out to be the worst possible matching for one set of agents and the best possible for the other. In this project, I mitigate the extreme polarity of the DAA using an evolutionary approach to find a stable matching, given two sets of individuals and their preferences.
